# Welcome to my Cybersecurity Data Visualization Project on Tableau

This is a trio of key dashboards that I've meticulously crafted. 
I've used various tools like dual-axis bar graphs, pie charts, tree maps, and through creating 
calculated fields to make them extra insightful. What you'll come across three distinct 
dashboards: one focused on breaking down Departments- Department Analysis, another giving 
you a peek into Employee Performance- Employee Analysis, and the third providing a 
comprehensive Branch Analysis.

These dashboards encapsulate the essence of the data, providing insights that can help drive 
informed decision-making processes.
